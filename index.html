        <h2>Tommy James is an incredible man</h2>
        <p>He makes my heart go boom-boto-bo-boom-boto-boom that super bass. And my cute little old man is almost 30</p>

        <p>Things that make me fall in love with Tommy James every day</p>
        <h2>Why He Rocks</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>He's got a cute little butt</li>
          <li>He's 500% more patient than I could ever be on my best day... and then some</li>
          <li>He's incredibly loving to our two furry girls</li>
          <li>He's fiercely loyal to the people he cares about</li>
          <li>He's so unapologetically himself. All the time. For better or worst.</li>
          <li>He doesn't mind doing the veryyyyyy annoying small things that I absolutely hate</li>
          <li>He could hear me blow up an entire toilet, clog said toilet, look crazy after fighting with said toilet, and still give me a forehead kiss at the end of the day</li>
          <li>He never asks me or anyone to be anyone than other who they are</li>
          <li>He's over all just incredible and I'm so grateful</li>  
        </ol>
        <h2>Tommy's the Cat Guy</h2>
        <p>Tommy has two fur daughters, who have made it into his 2024 girls, and who he has absolutely ruined their mother's iron first by being a big ol' softie. That said, I will continue to document every single instance I see of him and the girls sleeping together because it's literally too cute for words.</p>
